=======================
Subchapters in invoices
=======================

Add the invoice line types: Subtitle and Subsubtotal.

The amount of a **Subsubtotal** line is the sum of the amounts of the previous
lines since the previous **Subtotal** or **Subsubtotal**. It is the subchapter
amount.

The amount of a **Subtotal** line remains as the sum of the amounts of the
previous lines since the previous **Subtotal**, so it includes the subchapters
amounts (if they exists).
